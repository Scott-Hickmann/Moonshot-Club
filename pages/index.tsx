        Stanford Moonshot is the place for all forms of creativity to thrive:
        Want to ride a motorized couch around campus? Want to make customized
        cloaks for you and all your friends? How about using AI to make a chat
        bot to respond to all your messages for you? Have any other crazy
        project that you want to start but aren&apos;t sure how, or don&apos;t
        have the resources? Then this is the place for you!

        We host weekly Build Sessions where students can brainstorm and
        collaborate on projects, find peers with similar interests, and just
        enjoy the energy of a bustling makerspace. These events are a great
        place to learn the ropes, meet new people, and channel your creativity!

        We aim to combine innovative thinking and passion with technical
        know-how, so we welcome students of all backgrounds and interests. To
        arm our members with the knowledge they need to start their dream
        projects, we host workshops guided by peer experts on a variety of
        digital, technical, and craft skills. These workshops are a great way to
        try something new!

        We also host speaker events to give members a chance to hear from with
        successful speakers who embody our clubâ€™s mission of inclusive,
        collaborative tinkering for ambitious projects. These are a great
        opportunity to get the wisdom of successful figures in a variety of
        fields.
